      <b>Preface</b>
      <p>At the beginning of this year I got a computer. The computer both got my homework done faster, and slower. I would procrastinate the things I wouldn’t want to do so I could play games are do something else on the computer. As the year continued I had to figure out how to get my assignments done on the very thing that was distracting me. Making it less of a distraction and more of a tool for learning.</p>

      <b class=title>Death of Hector</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Obituary of Hector</b>
      <p>Hector a Trojan was killed after Heroically standing up the the warrior Achilles, after he was chased around the city many times. While his death may have been gruesome,  he stood against the gods in trying to protect his city. He represented his city and after his death everyone was very was mourning because he was the pride of their city and the son of King Priam.  Everyone in the city was mourning and saying talking about how they were doomed after his death. His brothers and fellow soldiers have similarly fallen to Achilles. His father as a last attempt went to ask Achilles if he could at least have the body, but Achilles refuses and drags him around and the body is eaten by dogs and worms. But while he: was alive he did lots of good things. He gave offerings to Apollo who wanted to spare Achilles but the other gods wouldn’t let him. He was also in charge of the horses and was pretty much the only son left to the king.
</p>
    <b>Reflection:</b>
    <p>
      There are multiple things this story portrayed that I am going to talk about. The first one is that life isn’t fair. In the story it talks about how the goddess Athena got hector and Achilles to stop running and fight each other. Achilles threw a spear but missed. Athena who Hector thought was being fair, gave the spear back to Achilles without Hector knowing, this was cheating but Hector really couldn’t do anything about it. Something I have learned from this is that even if others are doing horrible things, you just have to do your best as you can. The second is keep going. Hector kept running the entire time, but it wasn’t until he stopped that he lost the fight.

    </p>
    <br>
    <b>Analysis:</b>
    <p>What makes this piece of literature very different and unique from others is the amount of description it goes in to describe the events happening. This story is full of Imagery. There are some different part of this story that I will go over to show how Homer used his imagery to enrich the text we are reading. The first part is when they are describing what will happen to hector after he his dead. It says “glistening worms will wriggle through your flesh, once the dogs have had their fill of your naked corpse”. With this description you can clearly visualize everything that he writer wants you to see. Another example is where Achilles is chasing hector and they are compared to animals, where Achilles is a hound chasing a fawn. The exact words are “as a hound in the mountains starts a fawn from its lair … hiding deep in a bush but the hound comes running fast nosing him out until he lands his kill.” That's one of the things that makes this really hard to read. They are really descriptive which is good, but they often make references and use words that we may not fully understand.

      <b class=title>Beocat Poem</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p><img id=cat src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8yaU4UXg-tc/WwcR8dzi-AI/AAAAAAAAAQI/hOSTIwjToW8e1fsUIuLk1ndyw035tgPtQCLcBGAs/s512/Screenshot%2B2018-05-24%2Bat%2B1.26.09%2BPM.png'></p>
      <b>Reflection</b>
      <p>Beocat is a parody of the story Beowulf. It was filled with Alliteration and kenning, and was written in the same style as the original work Beowulf. The story of Beowulf is that of a monster named Grendel who is tormenting a group of people. Grendel then is eventually killed my the Hero Beowulf. Grendel has a dog, and the Parody is that Beowulf has a cat, Beocat and it wants a human to open the doors so it can go fight the dog. Some things I have learned from this story are thinking outside of the box, being more creative, making my things more interesting. Both the word choice and the Idea of the poem itself suggests that the Author was very good at thinking outside of the box. I feel like I could improve in this in my assignments. I’m not really the most creative person, so this is something I can definitely improve on weather it be in assignments, in my programming or in my spare time. This is probably the biggest effect Beocat has had on me. Another one is how informal and fun this piece of literature is. I also need to work on this. In school it seems that everything has to be serious all of the time. It is fun to have some fun sometimes.

      <b>Analysis:</b>
      <p>The author of this poem had a lot of alliteration. One example of alliteration was “The wary war-cat, whiskered paw-wielder.” This is really good alliteration. It shows that the author didn’t really want this to be necessarily historically accurate, along with kenning in this poem. But this poem is really laid back, but It has some interesting similarities to Beowulf. Another example is how the Author chooses to start the poem. “Brave Beocat, Brood-kit of Ecgthmeow…” I think the author chose to do this because it puts more emphasis into all the words that start with ‘b’. The author chooses to do this on almost every line, which makes the poem much more interesting than what it would be without. This is also part of the reason the Author put in so much kenning. Sometimes, you need some more words that start with the same letter, so you have to be creative. This is very well demonstrated in the following line. “Bearer of the burnished neck-belt, gold braided collar-band”. As you can see, neck-belt isn’t actually a thing, but you can tell it is a collar. These are the two literary elements that the author used really well in this poem to enrich the meaning of it. </p>

      <b>Gilgamesh</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Reflection:</b>
      <p>This one was really difficult to understand. The only page I really understood was the one where the snake stole the plant that would give gilgamesh immortal life at the very end after he had gone through a really long journey to find some dude who had immortal life. This taught me that sometimes if you work really hard on an assignment or something else, when you are done it doesn’t do anything for you because something like a snake will take it away from you. Maybe the snake is a metaphor. Gilgamesh was sleeping when the snake stole the plant, so the metaphor is that if have a project all done you can’t forget to turn it it. I have done this WAY to many times, and I probably would have perfect grades if I remembered to turn in my assignments on time. Continuing with this metaphor, if I didn’t procrastinate and do everything the night before it was due (right now), then I wouldn’t be sleeping when I need to turn in the assignment.
The epic of Gilgamesh may not have been a success for the outcome, but a success for the journey. He became a better ruler over his kingdom, and he learned a lot from his journey. So if I don’t get the assignment turned in then I still learn the stuff, and I benefited from the assignment that gave me zero points.
</p>
<b>Analysis:</b>
<p>One really prominent element in the epic of gilgamesh is foreshadowing. One spot where this shows a lot is when Enkidu and Gilgamesh have to fight a demon in the cedar forest. Enkidu ends up having three dreams and they try to interpret them as to whether they will have good luck or bad luck. One of his dreams was that they were walking through a deep gorge and a mountain fell on them. Enkidu interprets his dream and says they don’t have to worry about anything. He interprets it on how the demon is the mountain and they will die. But they decide it might not be real. After another series of dreams they end up fighting the demon Humbaba. They are not doing very well, and Gilgamesh and Enkidu keeps trying to encourage each other, eventually Gilgamesh pleads to one of the gods and the god send lots of storms which helps him defeat Humbaba. This literary element is used to explain how hard the fight against this demon is. Even though he ended up winning the gods cursed enkidu and made him die. Which is also foreshadowing that he will someday die. The rest of the book is about how Gilgamesh is trying to overcome death which he is destined that he will face. </p>

      <b>Conclusion</b>
      <p>In conclusion I have learned a lot of things this year at Itineris. I really should stop procrastinating and I will try to work on that later. I have learned a lot this year both about the content, and how to be organized and how to do homework effectively. I am really glad I came to this school even though I am leaving next year. One of the most important things you can learn is how to learn. If you know how to learn then you can learn anything. This is the most important thing i feel like you can learn in school.
